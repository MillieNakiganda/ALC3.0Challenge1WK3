Sorting:

Given an array containing numbers and one character strings, write a function that
takes the array and returns an object with property names evens, odds, and chars.
The value for evens is an array of sorted even numbers and odds is an array of
sorted odd numbers and chars is an array of sorted character strings.

arraySort([2,0,6,5,1,7,’z’,’a’])

# returns {‘evens’: [0,2,6], odds: [1,5,7], chars:[‘a’,’z’] }


In the arraysort folder there are two files arraysort.js and arraysort.test.js,
arraysort.test.js includes minimal tests for the challenge, implement arraySort() in
arraysort.js to pass all the tests. Feel free to write more tests in arraysort.test.js
